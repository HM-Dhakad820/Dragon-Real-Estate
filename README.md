# Dragon-Real-Estate
In this project we get a dataset from a Dragon company, on the basis of this dataset we have to predict the price of the property by using the Machine Learning Algorithm. In this project first we visualise the data and takeout some key points and on the basis of that keypoints, made a good model to predict the price.
